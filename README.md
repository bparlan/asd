Car import application, Reads images of subfolders in specific folder called "ASD" in C: drive ("c:\\ASD/"), user can give car properties (some of properties populated from Access DB such as Brand - Models and Customer Gallery contact informations) and Saves (outputs) as .txt files near images in specified format (spaces, line numbers important) for another macro program, which creates whole cars as .cdr for Corel Draw.

My first "proper" Visual C# program. I designed it just because I'm graphic designer in company and old version of this program sucks so hard that users of it creates horrible content for my CorelDraw, that consumes my nights in company. So here is well updated and greatly stable working version i done, cloe future shows that i'll write macro script (2nd phase of process) also. (which I create 3rd phase macro script to fix issues of 2nd phase before cracking it's passwords, but now I realise that 2nd phase "fixing" is impossible, will need to write it from 0 again).
